// Install Directions //

Let's get started.

Upload the latest version of dadCHECKIN to your web server's root directory. Be sure to set your directory privileges so your web servers has acess. For example:

    chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/dadCHECKIN 

If  you are new to the process of setting permissions on directories, read the short description below. If you are a SaltyDog, move on.
On an Ubuntu Linux web server, the recommended file permissions for the /var/www/html directory, which typically contains web content, are as follows:

Directories: 755 (drwxr-xr-x): This setting allows the owner to read, write, and execute, while the group and others can only read and execute. This is important for allowing web server processes to access and serve the directory contents.
Files: 644 (rw-r--r--): This means the owner can read and write the files, but the group and others can only read them. This ensures that web server processes can serve these files without unnecessary write permissions, which is a good security practice.

In Ubuntu Linux, the recommended file permissions for the /var/www/html directory are typically as follows:

    Directories: 755 (drwxr-xr-x)
    Files: 644 (rw-r--r--)


When you are sure of your file permissions, set them to (in my example): 

To set directory permissions to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):

    sudo find /var/www/html -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

To set file permissions to 644 (rw-r--r--):

    sudo find /var/www/html -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

    
It's crucial to set these permissions correctly to balance security and functionality.  Too restrictive permissions can prevent the web server from accessing these files, while too permissive settings can pose a security risk.

Let's run the installation script after you have set your ownership and directory permissions accordingly. 

Point your web browser to:

    http(s)://localhost/install/install.php

You will be asked to provide your database credentials to your database. This README is assuming you have already set those before you try to run the Install script. If you need help on that, this site is a good staring point, but you do  youQ https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/mysql/how-create-mysql-user-and-grant-permissions-command-line
    
        Start the installation by hitting the Install button. 

You will need to populate your database with the desired information for your dropdown menus. You will see the button that allows you to add Persons and Reasons for the visit. Point your browser to:

    http(s)://localhost/admin/

Add your data to the database.

In future distributions of dadCHECKIN I plan to add the authentication to protect your admin/ directory, but that will come a bit later, unless you want to do that work and contribute. Love to have. In the meantime, we are going to do this with a simple, and yes, I know, unsophisticated, use of the .htacces process.  

The primary reason for using .htaccess for basic authentication is to add a layer of security to your web directories. By requiring a username and password, you can restrict access to your admin/ directory.

I am suggesting this for now because of the ease of use and because I have not written this into the database yet.  Implementing basic authentication via .htaccess is straightforward and doesn't require extensive configuration changes in the main Apache configuration files. All of this is to say that you can apply these settings to specific directories without impacting the security or functionality of other parts of your website.
Control: It allows for decentralized management of access control. Different directories can have different authentication requirements.

Instructions for Password Protecting a Directory
Step 1: Create the .htaccess File

Open a terminal on your Ubuntu server. In this example I am assuming that you will put your files in the /var/www/html web root, but you may want to create a subdirectory like/var/www/html/dad/. In the end, you decide, Okay?

Navigate to your web directory:

    cd /var/www/html/admin

Create the .htaccess file:

    sudo nano .htaccess

Enter the following code into the file:

    apache
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Restricted Access"
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
    Require valid-user

Save and exit the editor (in nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, and Enter).

Step 2: Create the .htpasswd File (You'll need to create a .htpasswd file to store usernames and passwords. Use the htpasswd utility for this. If it's not installed, install it using);

    sudo apt-get install apache2-utils

--> (I know, it's old school)

Create the .htpasswd file and add a user (replace username with your desired username):

    sudo htpasswd -c /etc/apache2/.htpasswd username

You'll be prompted to enter and confirm the password.

Step 3: Update Apache Configuration

Ensure that your Apache configuration allows .htaccess overrides. Edit your Apache configuration file for the site:

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

Inside the section --> <Directory /var/www/html> section, add or modify the line:

    apache
    AllowOverride All

Save and exit the editor.

Step 4: Restart Apache:

    sudo systemctl restart apache2

To apply the changes, restart Apache:

// Test the Configuration

Open a web browser and navigate to the protected directory (e.g., http://yourserver.com/admin).

A login prompt should appear. Enter the username and password you created.

This setup will protect your /var/www/html/admin directory with basic authentication, restricting access to authorized users only. Just to remind you, basic authentication transmits credentials in an encoded but not encrypted form, so it's best to use it in conjunction with SSL/TLS for enhanced security.

Okay, that's it for now. If you need to connect with me, my deets are below.

Enjoy
